# Smart Contract Audits and Testing
  Welcome to my smart contract audit and testing repository. This project showcases my skills in carefully auditing smart contracts to ensure their security and optimize gas usage. The repository contains smart contracts that have been audited using [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) and [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna). Tested using [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) .

 ## Terminal Installation Commands

 ```
 pip3 install slither-analyzer 
```
2.solc (Solidity Compiler):
